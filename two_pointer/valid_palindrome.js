/* Instructions:
    Implement a function that checks if a given string is a valid palindrome.
    A valid palindrome is defined as a string that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
    Characters that are not alphanumeric should be ignored.
    Examples:
        Input: "Madam, I am Adam"
        Output: true
        Explanation: The string is a valid palindrome when ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
